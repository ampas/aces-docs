# Introduction
The ACES system is composed of many core components: encodings, transforms, metadata, and associated image files. 

ACES 1.0 was the first official release of these components. It was anticipated that at some point after initial adoption, the ACES system would require a revision to address user feedback, fix bugs and create a stable release that could have all its components standardized. In addition, ACES would always require updates to add new transforms to support new cameras, displays, or industry standards. Therefore, a specification for versioning of ACES system components and a guide to consistent naming of components is needed.

This document describes the versioning of the various engineering components that comprise the ACES System Release. These attributes can be referenced in the ACES Metadata File to describe the exact transforms used when ACES image files were viewed, created, or modified.

A separate document (Academy TB-2014-002) addresses naming of transforms and presentation of versioning information to end-users within the context of software or hardware implementing ACES transforms.
