### Working Group Participation
ACES is a community project that adheres to the principles of open source. Development work is primarily conducted in working groups organized by the ACES Leadership Team, with directional oversight by Architecture and Implementation Technical Advisory Committees (TACs).

Working groups function as topic-specific task forces that discuss and propose solutions to well-defined problems. The formation of groups and invitations for participation are announced on [ACESCentral.com](https://www.acescentral.com), with open participation to all interested individuals. Meetings are conducted virtually and recorded to maximize inclusivity. 

Between scheduled meetings, discussions of all kinds continue on the [ACESCentral.com discussion forums](https://community.acescentral.com). If you're interested in contributing to the field of color management and digital imagery, please consider participating in the discussions or joining a working group.


### Join the discussion on ACESCentral.com
ACESCentral houses information of all kinds with the goal of helping you share questions and answers to specific ACES related questions and issues with other ACES users of all levels of experience.

There are a number of professionals from the industry who are well versed in ACES and we have designated them as “Mentors”. They have agreed to monitor the forum and help answer questions as their time and expertise allow. There are also representatives from many of the ACES Product Partner companies who also monitor the forum and do their best to help answer questions or point you in the right direction for answers.

Please be polite, keep the conversation focused on ACES and filmmaking, don’t post 3rd party intellectual property you don’t have permission to post and avoid overtly commercial or sales oriented posts. See the [ACES Forum Rules and Guidelines post](https://community.acescentral.com/tos) for a complete list of what is or is not allowed.


### Code Contributions
To maintain the legal integrity of the project's codebase, we require all contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

#### Signing the CLA
- Before we can merge any of your contributions, you must sign our CLA.
- The process is simple: You will be prompted to sign the CLA online upon submitting a pull request for the first time.
- If you are contributing on behalf of your employer or if your contributions are owned by someone other than yourself (e.g. your employer), please make sure you have the right to submit the contributions under our project's CLA.

By signing the CLA, you assure the project and its users that your contributions do not infringe upon the rights of any third parties and that the project can use your contributions without legal repercussions.

If you have any questions about the CLA process, please feel free to contact a member of the ACES Team via [ACESCentral.com](http://community.ACESCentral.com).

#### Requirement for Signed Commits
As part of our commitment to security and the integrity of our codebase, we require all commits to be signed. This helps us ensure that contributions are actually made by the account they come from and not altered by a third party.

##### Why Signed Commits?
Signed commits provide an additional layer of security by guaranteeing that the commits are from a verified source. This is crucial for maintaining the trustworthiness of our codebase.

##### How to Sign Commits
To sign commits, you'll need to use a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) or S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) key. If you haven't already set up a GPG key, you can follow [GitHub's guide on generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key).

Once you have a GPG key, you can add it to your GitHub account. For instructions on how to do this, see [GitHub's documentation on adding a new GPG key to your account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).

When you have your GPG key added to your GitHub account, you can start signing your commits. If you're using the command line, you can sign commits with `git commit -S -m "Your commit message"`.

##### Verifying a Signed Commit
You can verify that your commits are signed by looking for the "Verified" label on GitHub's commit interface.

##### What if You Cannot Sign Your Commits?
We understand that in some scenarios, you might not be able to sign commits. If you find yourself in this situation, please reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.

For more detailed instructions on signing commits, you can refer to [GitHub's documentation on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits).

We appreciate your contributions to ACES, and we thank you for adhering to our signed commits policy. This policy helps us maintain the security and integrity of our codebase.

If you have any questions about this process, please feel free to contact the project maintainers.
