Academy Density Exchange Encoding (ADX)
=======================================

Academy Density Exchange (ADX) is a method of encoding APD density as 16-bit or 10-bit integer code values appropriatefor storage in digital files typically used for encoding motion picture negative and inter-negative film scans.

The Academy document that originally specified ADX has since been standardized through SMPTE as **SMPTE ST 2065-3 — Academy Density Exchange Encoding (ADX) — Encoding Academy Printing Density (APD) Values**

Additional background information about ADX will be added here in the future.
