Academy Printing Density (APD)
==============================

Academy Printing Density is a printing density metric defined by the spectral responsivities known as $\Pi_{APD}$, which is based on the spectral sensitivies of modern motion picture film print stocks and a motion picture printer light source.

The Academy document that originally specified APD has since been standardized through SMPTE as **SMPTE ST 2065-2 - Academy Printing Density (APD) â€” Spectral Responsivities, Reference Measurement Device and Spectral Calculation**

Additional background information about APD will be added here in the future.
