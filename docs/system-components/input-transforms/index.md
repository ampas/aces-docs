Input Transforms
================

The Input Transform, sometimes called an Input Device Transform or IDT, converts non-color-rendered RGB image values from a given camera system or other image capture device to ACES RGB relative exposure values.

The responsibilities of an IDT include: 

  - linearization, 
  - white balancing,
  - clipping, 
  - color analysis, 
  - neutral chromaticity difference compensation, and 
  - encoding as ACES RGB relative exposure values
